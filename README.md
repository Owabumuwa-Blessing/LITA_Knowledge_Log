## FOUNDATION OF DATA
The foundation of data refers to the basic principles and concepts that underpin how data is collected, managed, analyzed, and utilized in decision-making processes.
During the first week of training, we delved into several key topics, including data literacy, data generation, data sources, data structure, data storage, and data analysis. I gained an understanding of how organizations operate two primary systems: operational systems, which handle day-to-day transactions, and analytic systems, which focus on data insights and decision-making. A significant part of the discussions was centered on how to efficiently restructure and manage data using the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, which plays a crucial role in transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

## Data Structure
 * Structured Data: Organized data, typically in rows and columns (e.g., databases, spreadsheets).
 * Unstructured Data: Data that doesn’t follow a specific format (e.g., text files, social media posts, videos).
 * Semi-Structured Data: Contains elements of both structured and unstructured data (e.g., XML, JSON).

## Data Storage
It can happen in two main ways:
1. *On-Premises*:  
   - Data is stored within the organization's servers.
   - Accessible only from within the organization.
   - Offers more control and security but requires more maintenance.
2. *Cloud*:  
   - Data is stored remotely in data centers accessed via the internet.
   - Accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.
   - Flexible and scalable but relies on external service providers.
  
## Data Analysis
Data Analysis helps businessess make informed decisions, understand customer behaviour, improve operations, and predict future trends.
  - Helps organizations make decisions based on actual data rather than intuition or guesswork.
  - Identifies inefficiencies in processes, leading optimization and cost reduction.
  - Identifies target markets and creating more effective marketing strategies.
  - Helps in assessing credit risk, fraud detection, and compliance with regulatory standards.
  - It can also enhance transparency with stakeholders, improving the company’s reputation and brand loyalty.
  - Data-driven insights can lead to the development of new products or services by identifying unmet customer needs or market gaps.

## TOOLS USED

Fields in the Dataset:
 - **Region:** Geographic area.
 - **Market:** State the store operates in.
 - **Store:** City of the store.
 - **Trade Date:** Date of the transaction.
 - **Fiscal Period:** Financial period.
 - **Model:** Product model or category.
 - **Line of Business:** Business sector.
 - **Day Category:** Transaction day classification (e.g., weekday, weekend).
 - **Revenue:** Total sales amount.
 - **Units Sold:** Quantity of items sold.
 - **Transaction Category:** Each sale is classified into one of these three categories (Low, Medium, or High) based on the number of units sold.

## Observation and Conclusion
**Revenue by Region:** The revenue analysis by region highlights the North East as the most profitable area, while the South West and South South also contribute significantly. The North Central region, however, presents an opportunity for further development. Targeted marketing strategies and tailored approaches to increase engagement in lower-performing regions could help optimize overall revenue across the country.

**Monthly Revenue:** By identifying potential seasonal trends, adjusting marketing efforts, and optimizing product offerings, the business can aim to maintain higher revenue levels consistently across all months.
   * Peak Revenue Months: The highest revenue was recorded in March (₦8,458,780,440), followed closely by May (₦8,348,649,000).
   * Decline in Mid-Year: Revenue saw a significant drop starting in July, with monthly figures dropping to below ₦4 billion. This decline continues through December.
   * Lowest Revenue Months: July recorded the lowest revenue at ₦3,976,032,960, with similar low figures in the subsequent months, indicating a potential seasonal downturn.

**Units Sold by Region:** The analysis of units sold by region shows that the North East is the leading market, followed by the South West and South South. The North Central region presents an opportunity for improvement. To optimize overall sales, businesses should consider targeted marketing efforts and strategies aimed at boosting engagement and sales in regions with lower performance.

**Revenue by Transaction Category:** Strategies should prioritize boosting revenue from medium transactions while also seeking opportunities to enhance high-value sales.
   * Low Transaction Category: Despite accounting for the largest number of units sold (14,763 units), the low category generates less revenue compared to the medium category. This suggests that items in this category are priced lower, which impacts the total revenue generated, even though sales volume is high.
   * Medium Transaction Category: This category contributes the largest share of the overall revenue. Even though it ranks second in terms of units sold (12,016 units), the revenue it generates is the highest. This could imply that items in the medium category have a balanced mix of volume and pricing, making it a key driver of revenue.
   * High Transaction Category: Although this category has the lowest number of units sold (4,020 units), it still contributes a notable share of the revenue, which indicates that the items in this category are of higher value, generating more revenue per transaction. However, since fewer units are sold, its contribution to the overall revenue is the smallest.

## SQL CLASS
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language specifically designed for managing, querying, and manipulating relational databases. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. 

## SQL Commands
 - SQL commands are instructions. It is used to communicate with the database.
 - It is also used to perform specific tasks, functions, and queries of data.
 - SQL can perform various tasks like create a table, add data to tables, drop the table, modify the table, set permission
for users.
### Types of SQL Commands
There are five types of SQL commands:
 - DDL: Data Definition Language
 - DML: Data Manipulation Language
 - DCL: Data Control Language
 - TCL: Transaction Control Language
 - DQL: Data Query Language

## Key SQL Concepts
1. Databases and Tables
      * Database: A structured collection of data. Think of it as a file cabinet containing organized information.
      * Table: A structured format within a database that consists of rows and columns (similar to Excel spreadsheets). Each row represents a record, and each column represents a field (attribute) within the data.
2. SQL Queries A query is a request for data or information from a database. It allows users to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data from database tables.
3. Data Types Every column in a table has a data type that defines the kind of data it can hold:Numeric Data Types, Character String Data Types, Binary Data Types, Date and Time Data Types.

## SQL Keys
They are fundamental concepts in relational database design and management. They are used to uniquely identify records within tables and establish relationships between different tables. Understanding SQL keys is essential for maintaining data integrity and enforcing constraints within a database.

This capability allows me to centralize diverse datasets, enabling streamlined analysis and a more cohesive understanding of the information at hand.

A pivotal skill I’ve developed is the use of Power Query for data cleaning, shaping, and transformation prior to analysis. This stage of the process is critical, as it ensures that the data is accurate and ready for in-depth examination. I have mastered tasks like removing duplicates, changing data types, merging tables, and executing more complex transformations. These steps not only enhance the quality of the data but also ensure that the insights generated are reliable.

In Power BI, I've expanded my expertise in creating calculated fields and measures through DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). This powerful tool enables me to derive insights such as cumulative totals, moving averages, and percentage changes. By harnessing DAX, I can perform advanced analytical functions that provide stakeholders with a richer, more comprehensive view of the data, ultimately allowing for better-informed decision-making.

A significant aspect of my learning has involved visualization design. I've dedicated time to developing dashboards that strike a balance between aesthetic appeal and functional layout. By incorporating elements like slicers, filters, and drill-down features, I’ve created interactive visuals that empower users to engage with the data more meaningfully and explore insights independently.

Through Power BI, I am learning to support data-driven decision-making more effectively. My dashboards not only track key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify trends, but they also communicate performance insights clearly and compellingly. This experience has significantly enriched my data storytelling skills, enabling me to deliver actionable insights that resonate with stakeholders.

Overall, my Power BI journey has been transformative, equipping me with the skills and confidence to turn data into valuable insights. I look forward to continuing this journey, further honing my abilities in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling to make a lasting impact in the field.

## HR ANALYSIS
This project was completed as part of a classroom exercise, where I learned to analyze HR data and present insights using Power BI. The goal was to track key HR metrics, including the total number of employees, attrition count, active employees, attrition rate, and average age.

The dashboard offers a comprehensive look at employee attrition, providing insights that are essential for strategic HR planning. By visualizing attrition by department, educational background, and gender, the dashboard highlights critical patterns in turnover rates. These insights give HR teams a clear starting point for identifying high-risk areas and developing retention strategies tailored to specific groups. Additionally, the dashboard segments data by age groups, with further breakdowns by gender, to deepen the understanding of demographic trends within attrition rates.

Key HR metrics—including hours worked, environmental satisfaction, gender distribution, attrition rates, and work-life balance—are prominently featured, allowing stakeholders to grasp the factors influencing employee retention. The dashboard’s interactive elements, such as filters for job roles and departments, make it adaptable for more detailed analyses, enabling users to pinpoint specific issues within various segments.

This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with HR analytics, demonstrating the use of Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights. I created several key measures:
 - Attrition Rate: This measure is calculated by dividing the attrition count by the total number of employees, offering a quick overview of turnover levels across the organization.
 - Active Employees: Derived by subtracting the total attrition count from the overall employee count, this measure indicates the current number of employees who are still with the company.
 - Average Age of Employees: This measure helps to identify the average age of employees within the organization, which can be correlated with attrition trends.
 - Average Distance from Home: By calculating the average commute distance for employees, we can assess if this factor may impact job satisfaction and retention.
 - Average Monthly Income and Monthly Rate: These metrics provide a quick reference for financial benchmarks across different roles, highlighting the overall average monthly income and rate within the organization.
 - Attrition Rate: Calculated as the ratio of attrition count to the total number of employees, this measure offers a quick gauge of turnover intensity across departments, educational fields, and other segments.
 - Active Employees: This measure, calculated by subtracting the total attrition count from the employee count, provides a snapshot of the current workforce size, giving HR teams an accurate picture of employee retention.
These calculated measures contribute to a more granular understanding of employee dynamics and help HR teams prioritize their retention efforts. By engaging with the dashboard, HR professionals can make informed, data-driven decisions that align with the organization’s strategic goals and enhance overall employee satisfaction and retention.

I incorporated three conditional columns into the dataset: one for attrition count, another for age sorting, and a third for job satisfaction ratings. This enhancement provides additional layers of analysis to better understand the factors influencing employee retention.
